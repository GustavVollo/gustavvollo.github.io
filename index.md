### Home Credit Default

#### [Project Overview:](https://github.com/GustavVollo/Home-Credit-Default-Project)

- Home Credit is dedicated to providing credit services to unbanked and underbanked populations, often considered high-risk due to their lack of traditional credit history. Using predictive analytics, the company enhances risk assessment and promotes fair credit access, aiming to reduce loan defaults and include those usually excluded from the financial system.

- Our predictive model, utilizing over 356,000 client records, revolutionizes loan applicant assessment. This approach reduces default risks and provides credit access to those without traditional financial histories, crucial for sustainable default rate reduction and economic resilience in emerging markets.

- The project utilized the XGBoost algorithm for its high accuracy in outcome prediction. Despite high scores, the model initially underpredicted defaults, highlighting the need for a balanced representation of default cases. Our analysis identified key variables for loan repayment, focusing our data collection on the most predictive elements for future loan processing.

- In sum, our project demonstrated the importance of balancing financial inclusion with risk management. It illustrated the relationship between increased financial inclusion and rising risk, emphasizing the need for a strategic approach in credit services.
