### Home Credit Default

#### [Project Overview:](https://github.com/GustavVollo/Home-Credit-Default-Project)

##### Commitment to Financial Inclusion
Home Credit is committed to providing credit services to unbanked and underbanked populations, who are often viewed as high-risk due to their lack of a traditional credit history. By leveraging predictive analytics, the company aims to enhance risk assessment and promote fair credit access, thus aiming to reduce loan defaults and include those usually excluded from the financial system.

##### Innovations in Credit Assessment
Our predictive model leverages data from over 356,000 client records to revolutionize the assessment of loan applicants. This innovative approach helps to mitigate default risks and extends credit access to individuals lacking traditional financial records. This is vital for maintaining sustainable default rates and enhancing economic resilience in emerging markets.

##### Enhancements Through Advanced Analytics
The project employs the XGBoost algorithm, known for its high accuracy in outcome prediction. Despite achieving high scores, the initial model underpredicted defaults, which underscored the need for a balanced representation of default cases in the data. Our analysis pinpointed key variables essential for loan repayment, refining our data collection focus on the most predictive elements for future loan processing. This approach underscores the balance between extending financial inclusion and managing associated risks.
